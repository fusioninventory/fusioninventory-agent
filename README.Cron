WARNING: FusionInventory Agent would better be installed as systemd service and
this is the recommanded way of doing.

FusionInventory agent is expected to run its tasks on a regular basis and is better
installed as service. Its memory and load footprints are low enough for this mode.

To know better about the FusionInventory agent execution modes, you should be read
the our online Agent usage page:
http://fusioninventory.org/documentation/agent/usage.html

Cron mode could be used if you don't want a fusioninventory-agent process to be running
all the time and if you don't need to trigger it remotely (from the server
or manually, locally contacting the `http://localhost:62354/` page).

So if you prefer to run FusionInventory Agent as scheduled cron job, you may need
to do the following as root:
1. stop and disable the fusioninventory-agent service (if start/enabled):
   systemctl stop fusioninventory-agent
   systemctl disable fusioninventory-agent

2. create a /etc/fusioninventory/conf.d/better-for-cron.cfg file with the following
   lines:
   # Don't force agent to run inventory at each run, but only
   # after server defined timeout has been reached
   lazy = 1

3. as example, add a root cron job like this:
   # Don't remove --wait option (delay in seconds) so the agent wait a random
   # time before really run its work
   00 */4 * * * /usr/bin/fusioninventory-agent --wait=1800 >/var/lib/fusioninventory-agent/cron.log 2>&1

For large companies, be aware, if you don't enable lazy option in cron mode and you schedule
many computer to make inventory at the same cron time, you can flood your GLPI server at the
scheduled time, even more if you forget to use `--wait` option. To avoid such missconfiguration,
you would prefer leave the agent started as systemd service and define a peaceful delay
on server. You may adjust scheduled time and wait command line only option to your needs.

As a reminder, cron mode disables the httpd daemon listening feature permitting server
to manually and remotely trigger fusioninventory-agent to run its tasks.
