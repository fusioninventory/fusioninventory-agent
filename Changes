2.2.0  Sat, 07 Apr 2012

Major changes:
* large speed improvement: up to 150% for a local inventory
* better multitasking support:
 - the agent use fork() to run task if needed, instead of running a new process
   from scratch, avoiding the need to use a temporary file to transmit
   parameters, with related security risks
 - the agent only forks to run a tasks when running as a server, making tracing
   and debugging easier
 - the agent only use one thread for the web interface
* better SSL support:
  - IO::Socket::SSL perl module is now required for certificate validation
  - Crypt::SSLeay perl module still allow HTTPS support, but without
    certificate validation, and the connection will be aborted unless
    certificate checking is disabled
  - validation is now performed by SSL library, and honours alternative subject
    names, and other subtilities
* large cleanup of values returned from inventory:
  - unknown values are filtered out
  - strings are trimmed for trailing spaces
  - irrelevant values, such as windows internal USB serial number, or
    controllers type and manufacturer on AIX and HPUX, are filtered out
* installation procedure automatically setup configuration and data directories
  locations in executable, there is no need to manually configure them anymore
* removal of useless features:
  - support for OCS account info have been dropped, the agent doesn't store
    arbitrary informations locally anymore
  - support for OCS network discovery and software deployment features within
    inventory task have been removed, we have better alternatives
  - useless Ping task has been dropped
* cleanup of available options:
  - deprecated --nosoft and --nosoftware options have been removed
  - --devlib, --share-dir, --basevardir and --realm options have been
    deprecated, as their values are now computed automatically at installation
  - --daemon-no-fork option has been deprecated, and replaced by --daemon
    --no-fork options
  - --info option has been deprecated, as it had no effect
  - --rpc-trust-localhost option has been deprecated, in favor of a more
    generic --http-trust option, allowing an arbitrary IP adresse or range
  - --debug option can be specified multiple times, for additional verbosity
  - --no-inventory, --no-ocsdeploy, --no-snmpquery, --no-netdiscovery options
    have been deprecated in favor of a generic --no-task option
  - --no-software, --no-printer options have been deprecated in favor of a
    generic --no-category option, and 'environment' value support has been added
* new --config option allows to select configuration backend, allowing to use
  file configuration if needed under windows, or to ignore any external
  configuration
* fusioninventory-agent-config executable has been dropped, in favor of better
  documentation
* documentation has been reviewed for consistency in various places where it
  appears (--help output, man page, configuration file)
* XML::TreePP perl module is now used instead of XML::Simple, reducing native
  perl modules dependencies
* OcsDeploy task is now deprecated. Please continue to use the 2.1.x agent is
  you need it.

Minor changes:
* Add the HARDWARE/CHASSIS_TYPE information
* Linux: report all IP addresses used by each interfaces (#854)
* HPUX: don't report unoccupied memory slots
* AIX: add LVM support
