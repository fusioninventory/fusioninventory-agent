DESCRIPTION

  FusionInventory-Agent is an agent for OCS NG & GLPI. It supports Linux,
  Solaris and AIX. *BSD support is in progress. A port to non UNIX system
  is also possible (e.g: Win32).

PREREQUISITES

  Perl 5.8.
  The following modules are needed:
    Digest::MD5

    XML::Simple

    Net::IP: optional, it is only needed to compute the network information

    LWP

    dmidecode on Linux and *BSD (i386, amd64, ia64) dmidecode is required to read the BIOS stats.

    lspci on Linux and *BSD (pciutils package) is required to list PCI devices.

    Mac::SysProfile 0.0.3 is need on MacOSX to collect the device informations.

    sneep on Solaris/sparc, you must install sneep and record the Serial Number with it :
                  (download it from http://www.sun.com/download/products.xml?id=4304155a)

 
  The following modules are optional:

    Proc::Daemon Daemon mode

    Proc::PID::File brings the pid file support if Proc::Daemon is installed

    ipmitool if you want to collect information about IPMI

    Compress::Zlib needed for OCS server prior 1.02

    To get the serial number of the screen you will need one of these tools:
      - monitor-edid from Mandriva is needed to fetch the monitor. A package is available
        in Fedora repository.
        information http://wiki.mandriva.com/en/Tools/monitor-edid
      - get-edid from the read-edid package

    If available, Net::CUPS is used to detect the printer

    File::Copy::Recursive


  The following module is needed if you plan to prepare a tarball or install
  directly from the Bazaar devel branch. (See SOURCES below.):

    Module::Install (Ubuntu package libmodule-install-perl). 

BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make install

  If you want to turn of the interactive post install script, just do
       PERL_AUTOINSTALL=1 perl Makefile.PL
  instead of the 
       perl Makefile.PL

  You can also run the agent from the tarball directory. In this case, use
  the --devlib flag to load the library from the local directory.

  The agent needs some directories to store internal settings.

  you can choose other directories by changing the default settings
  directly in the fusioninventory-agent config file.

  You need to launch the agent with root privilege. For debugging you can
  try to launch it with the -l flag:
  eg: fusioninventory-agent -l /tmp --debug

  It's also possible to run directly from the tarball directory:

   sudo ./fusioninventory-agent --devlib --server http://server/ocsinventory

PATCHES
  If you want to improve FusionInventory, please use the Bazaar branch
  directly, publish you changes and ask for the merge
  http://launchpad.net/fusioninventory-agent

  The source of the agent can be download with this command:

  bzr branch lp:FusionInventory-unix-agent

  /!\ You may need bzr-loom plugin to retrieve the branch /!\ 


NOTE
 
 Solaris:
  Sun Studio seems to be needed to build the dependency.
  The generated Makefile needs gmake to be exectuted
  The default installation will install the binary in /usr/perl5/5.XXXXX/bin,
  set you $PATH variable according to that.

 Crontab:
  If you use the crontab to launch the agent you'll probably have to redefine
  the PATH. For example, just add something like:
  PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin
  At the begining of the cron file.


SOURCES
You can prepare a tarball from the Bazaar devel branch with following commands:
   bzr branch lp:fusioninventory-agent
   cd fusioninventory-agent
   perl Makefile.PL
   make manifest
   make dist
