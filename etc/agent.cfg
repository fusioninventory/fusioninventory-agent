# Since 2.4, you can include all .cfg files from a folder or any given file
# For example:
#   1. file "conf.d/tag.cfg" contains "tag = 'entity123'"
#      using "include 'conf.d' will set tag to 'entity123'
#   2. file "/etc/production/glpi-tag" contains "tag = 'entity123'"
#      using "include '/etc/production/glpi-tag' will set tag to 'entity123'
# Remark:
#   1. Prefer to use full path to avoid confusion, but be aware relative paths are
#      relative against current config file folder
#   2. A parameter set in included file can be over-rided if set again after the directive
#   3. *.cfg files are read in order in folder, it's better to prefix them with a number
#   4. Package maintainers are encouraged to use this feature to avoid conflict
#      during upgrades after configuration update
